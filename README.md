A deterministic generator of piano compositions using Conway's Game of Life and an custom extended theory of uniform triadic transformations.

## Concept 


The user chooses a starting state for Conway's Game of Life and a starting seventh chord. <br>
Each new state performs a transformation on the previous chord and generates a melody and harmony 
line for the right and left hands, respectively. <br>
The composition is output as [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) code, which the user can paste into [omet.ca](https://ide.omet.ca/) 
to create sheet music. <br>
Detailed information about chord transformations and automaton mapping 
can be found in the [write-up](https://ryurongliu.github.io/transformative-living/writeup.html).
